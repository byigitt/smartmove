Metro Passenger Data Generator

This script generates synthetic metro passenger data with realistic patterns:
- 4 metro lines (M1-M4) with 57 stations total
- Bell-curve distribution of passengers (peaks at central stations)
- Time-based variations (peak hours, off-peak hours)
- Different station types (central, junction, terminal, regular)
- Transfer patterns at junction stations
- Weekend vs weekday patterns
